## MeshQL Overview

**Project Name:** MeshQL  
**Repository:** [tsmarsh/meshql](https://github.com/tsmarsh/meshql)

### Description
MeshQL is a lightweight and dynamic GraphQL-based service mesh aimed at simplifying the integration and orchestration of microservices in a distributed environment. Its core functionality allows for seamless communication between services while providing robust features for querying and manipulating data in real time.

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic GraphQL Schema**: Automatically adapt to changes in microservice endpoints or business logic without requiring extensive manual updates.
2. **Service Discovery**: Built-in mechanisms to detect and integrate services on the network.
3. **High Performance**: Designed with low overhead to ensure efficient communication between services.
4. **Security**: Fine-grained access controls to ensure secure communication and data access.
5. **Flexibility**: Cloud-agnostic and suitable for hybrid environments.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
1. Node.js (v16+ recommended)
2. Yarn or npm
3. Docker (optional, for running services in containers)

#### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsmarsh/meshql.git
cd meshql
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

#### Running the Application
To start the MeshQL service locally:
```bash
yarn start
```
The service will run on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

### Architecture
MeshQL consists of the following core components:
1. **GraphQL Gateway**: Central point for querying services.
2. **Service Connectors**: Modules that interact with individual microservices.
3. **Orchestration Engine**: Manages routing and execution of complex queries.
4. **Security Layer**: Handles authentication and authorization.

### Contribution
We welcome contributions to MeshQL! To contribute:
