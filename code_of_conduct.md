   Contributions should demonstrate technical rigor, efficiency, and clarity. Priority will always be given to ideas and code that objectively improve the project.

2. **Respect for Expertise**  
   Engage in discussions that focus on technical merit. Respect the expertise and time of others by providing well-researched, thoughtful contributions.

3. **Productive Collaboration**

    - Disagreements should be professional and solution-oriented.
    - Debates should remain focused on the code, not the individual.
    - Avoid unproductive or tangential discussions that do not advance the project.

    - Accept feedback as an opportunity to improve your work.

## Technical Excellence

Technical excellence is a moving target that reflects the best balance between pragmatism and scientific endeavor. The following principles guide the pursuit of excellence:

- **Pragmatism**: Solutions should be effective and efficient, balancing immediate project needs with long-term maintainability. Avoid overengineering or premature optimization.

- **Scientific Approach**: Innovations and improvements should be guided by evidence, benchmarks, and data. Use experimentation and research to justify complex or non-standard approaches.

- **Clarity**: Code should be written for humans first, machines second. Favor readability and simplicity over cleverness.

- **Adaptability**: Recognize that the best solution today may not be the best tomorrow. Be open to revisiting and refining decisions as new tools, techniques, or requirements emerge.

- **Collaboration in Craftsmanship**: Seek peer input on significant changes to ensure a diverse range of perspectives and avoid blind spots.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks or attempts to undermine contributors based on non-technical factors.
- Introducing unnecessary complexity, scope creep, or unproductive debate.
- Engaging in hostile, dismissive, or combative interactions.
- Submitting plagiarized or knowingly subpar code.
