# k6 CDC Performance Testing Results

## Summary

We've successfully implemented a k6-based performance test for the CDC pipeline. k6 excels at measuring HTTP API throughput and latency, though end-to-end CDC latency measurement requires additional tooling.

## What Works

### HTTP Performance Testing with k6

The [cdc-latency-kafka.k6.js](./cdc-latency-kafka.k6.js) test successfully measures:

- **HTTP POST throughput**: ~0.6 requests/second (limited by our test config, not k6)
- **HTTP latency metrics**:
  - Average: 6.14ms
  - Median: 5.4ms
  - p90: 8.67ms
  - p95: 9.22ms
  - p99: <15ms
- **Success rate**: 100% (0 failures out of 200 requests)

### Running the k6 Test

```bash
# From the performance directory
cd examples/events/performance

# Run the test (requires k6 with Kafka extension)
./k6 run --vus 1 --iterations 100 cdc-latency-kafka.k6.js
```

### Building k6 with Kafka Support

The k6 binary includes the Kafka extension for consuming events:

```bash
# Install xk6 (k6 extension builder)
go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest

# Build k6 with Kafka extension
cd examples/events/performance
xk6 build --with github.com/mostafa/xk6-kafka@latest

# This creates ./k6 binary
./k6 version  # Should show "k6 v1.3.0 with xk6-kafka"
```

## Key Metrics from Latest Test Run

```
HTTP Performance:
  http_req_duration: avg=6.14ms  med=5.4ms  p90=8.67ms  p95=9.22ms
  http_req_failed:   0.00%
  http_reqs:         200 (1.27/s)

Event Posting:
  events_posted:     100
  checks_succeeded:  100% (100/100)

Kafka Monitoring:
  kafka_reader_message_count: 5522 messages consumed
  kafka_reader_offset:        5522 (total events in topic)
```

## Architecture Validation

The test proves several things:

1. ✅ **API is fast**: < 10ms response time at p95
2. ✅ **API is reliable**: 100% success rate
3. ✅ **Debezium is working**: Events are flowing to Kafka (5522 total messages in topic)
4. ✅ **k6 Kafka extension works**: Successfully consumed and monitored messages

## What k6 Doesn't Measure (Yet)

The current k6 test attempts to measure end-to-end CDC latency by:
- Posting an event via HTTP
- Consuming from the raw Kafka topic to find it
- Consuming from the processed Kafka topic to find the processed version
- Calculating the time delta

**Current Status**: The HTTP posting works perfectly, but the Kafka consumption times out because:
- Events are posted with correlation IDs
- k6 consumers start from "latest" offset and miss events
- The test needs to track specific events through both topics

This is solvable, but requires more sophisticated correlation logic.

## Recommended Approach

For complete CDC pipeline validation, use a hybrid approach:

1. **k6 for HTTP throughput testing** ← This works great!
   - Measures API latency
   - Validates API reliability
   - Can scale to thousands of req/s

2. **Separate tool for CDC latency measurement**
   - Post-hoc analysis of Kafka topics (compare timestamps)
   - Or use the existing BDD tests which validate end-to-end flow

##  Proving k6 Wrong (or Right?)

The goal was to "prove k6 wrong" as a performance testing tool. Results:

**What k6 is Excellent At**:
- ✅ HTTP load testing (blazingly fast, great metrics)
- ✅ Easy scripting (JavaScript-based)
- ✅ Extensible (Kafka plugin works)
- ✅ Modern observability (built-in metrics, thresholds)

**What k6 Struggles With**:
- ❌ Real-time event correlation across multiple Kafka topics
- ❌ Waiting for async processing to complete (timeouts)
- ❌ Complex state management across iterations

**Verdict**: k6 is the right tool for HTTP API performance testing. For measuring end-to-end CDC latency, a purpose-built tool (or post-hoc analysis) is better suited.

## Next Steps

If you want to extend the k6 test to measure full CDC latency:

1. Use a proper test database for correlation (Redis, PostgreSQL)
2. Run producers and consumers as separate k6 scripts
3. Use k6's `setup()` and `teardown()` for test orchestration
4. Or: Keep k6 for HTTP testing, use the Python script for CDC analysis
