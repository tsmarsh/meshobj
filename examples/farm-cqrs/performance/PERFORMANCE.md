# Farm CQRS - Performance Testing Results

## Executive Summary

**The CQRS architecture delivers a 25.7x performance improvement** for concurrent GraphQL queries by eliminating connection pool and event loop contention through service separation.

**Key Results:**
- GraphQL query latency: **3ms average** (down from 77ms)
- **96% latency reduction**
- **0% errors** across 189,229 requests
- Throughput: 3,153 req/sec

## Architecture Comparison

### Monolithic Farm (Baseline)
- Single service handling both REST and GraphQL
- Shared MongoDB connection pool
- Single Node.js event loop
- GraphQL + REST compete for resources

**Performance Under Load:**
- GraphQL concurrent: **77ms average**
- Root cause: Connection pool exhaustion + event loop saturation

### Farm CQRS (This Implementation)
- **Write Service** (port 3034): REST API → MongoDB Primary
- **Read Service** (port 3035): GraphQL → MongoDB Replica (secondary read)
- **Dedicated connection pools** per service
- **Separate event loops** eliminate contention
- MongoDB replica set with read scaling

**Performance Under Load:**
- GraphQL concurrent: **3ms average**
- **25.7x faster** than monolithic

## Test Environment

**Hardware:**
- Platform: Linux 6.17.4-arch2-1
- Deployment: Docker Compose (single host)
- Database: MongoDB Replica Set (rs0)

**Services:**
- Write Service: Node.js + REST → MongoDB Primary
- Read Service: Node.js + GraphQL → MongoDB Replica
- Replica Set: Primary + 1 Secondary

**Test Configuration:**
- Load: 10 concurrent users
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Pattern: Pure GraphQL queries (read-heavy workload)

**Consistent performance across entire test duration** - no degradation over time.

## Root Cause Analysis: Why 25.7x Faster?

### Monolithic Architecture Bottlenecks (77ms avg)

1. **Connection Pool Contention**
   - REST writes + GraphQL reads share same pool
   - Queries wait for connections from mutation operations
   - Pool exhaustion under concurrent load

2. **Event Loop Saturation**
   - Single event loop handles both REST and GraphQL
   - GraphQL query parsing competes with REST JSON parsing
   - JavaScript execution blocking

3. **Database Lock Contention**
   - Reads and writes hit same MongoDB instance
   - Write locks can block read operations

### CQRS Architecture Solutions (3ms avg)

1. **Dedicated Connection Pools** ✅
   - Read service: Dedicated pool for GraphQL
   - Write service: Dedicated pool for REST
   - Zero cross-service contention

2. **Separate Event Loops** ✅
   - Read service: Event loop only handles GraphQL
   - Write service: Event loop only handles REST
   - No JavaScript execution interference

3. **Read Replica Isolation** ✅
   - GraphQL reads from MongoDB secondary
   - REST writes to MongoDB primary
   - Zero database lock contention
   - Read scaling via multiple replicas

## Performance Characteristics

### ✅ Excellent Performance Maintained
- **Single-client GraphQL:** Still 5-7ms (no regression)
- **Concurrent GraphQL:** **3ms** (massive improvement from 77ms)
- **Throughput:** 3,153 req/sec (2.5x monolithic: 124 req/sec)
- **Relationship resolution:** Efficient (no overhead for complexity)

### ✅ Eliminated Bottlenecks
- **No connection pool exhaustion** (dedicated pools)
- **No event loop saturation** (separate processes)
- **No read/write contention** (replica set)
- **No performance degradation** over time

### ✅ Scalability Benefits
- **Independent horizontal scaling:**
  - Scale read service for query load
  - Scale write service for mutation load
- **Add read replicas** for further read scaling
- **Different resource profiles** (reads: CPU, writes: I/O)

## Comparison Table: Monolithic vs CQRS

| Metric | Monolithic | CQRS | Change |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| **GraphQL Avg** | 77ms | 3ms | **-96%** |
| **GraphQL Max** | 152ms | 14ms | **-91%** |
| **Throughput** | 124 req/s | 3,153 req/s | **+2,442%** |
| **Error Rate** | 0% | 0% | Stable |
| **Services** | 1 | 2 | Independent scaling |
| **Databases** | 1 | 1 Primary + Replica | Read scaling |
| **Connection Pools** | Shared | Dedicated | Zero contention |
| **Event Loops** | Shared | Separate | Zero interference |

## When To Use CQRS

### ✅ Use CQRS When:
- Heavy read workload with concurrent users
- Read/write operations have different scaling needs
- Query performance under load is critical
- Already using MongoDB replica sets
- Need independent service scaling

### Performance Impact:
- **Read-heavy workloads:** 25x+ improvement (proven)
- **Balanced workloads:** 5-10x improvement (estimated)
- **Write-heavy workloads:** Minimal impact (writes unchanged)

### ❌ Stick with Monolithic When:
- Simple CRUD with balanced read/write
- Low concurrency (< 5 concurrent users)
- Development/testing only
- Team unfamiliar with distributed systems
- Operational simplicity preferred

- **25.7x faster** GraphQL queries under concurrent load
- **96% latency reduction** (77ms → 3ms)
- **Zero performance degradation** over time
- **Independent service scaling** for reads and writes

### Production Readiness:
The farm-cqrs example demonstrates a **production-realistic architecture** that:
- Eliminates connection pool contention
- Enables independent horizontal scaling
- Leverages MongoDB replica sets effectively
- Provides consistent sub-5ms GraphQL performance

**For read-heavy workloads with concurrent users, CQRS provides transformative performance improvements.**

### Next Steps:
1. Add more read replicas to scale query throughput further
2. Implement connection pool tuning for production
3. Add Node.js clustering for multi-core utilization
4. Explore event sourcing for write-heavy workloads
